	    <p>
	    	Everything is sorted by it's page based on the destination url in reverse alphbetical order (primarily affected by the fiction number, not the title). This means that all the ads for a fiction should hopefully be together, and amazon and podium ads get sent to the bottom. Because of how fictions are numbered, large chunks of this list might be in chronological order, but I make no promises. I do not include the site ads for premium, because they store the images somewhere else and I'm too lazy to manually get the six(ish) ads.

    		Full list
		</a>
		<p>
			The list of all the ads I have. Most frequently updated.
		</p>

		<p>
			I was convinced to sort the ads into various groups. I sorted them initially, then realised I don't want to do it again. I you want to help, correct a mistake, or get me to put your name on here, I made a <a href="https://emmalemon2.github.io/rr-ad-list/ad-sorter.html">sorting page</a> for you to contribute.

		<a href="a.html" style="color: white; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; background-color: blue; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    		Thirst trap purgatory
		</a>
		<p>
			All the ads whos main selling point is just an oversexualised image, and a few characters that were just unnecessarily well endowed. Also a couple that looked at me funny while I was sorting. I let a couple of harem story ads pass, because they're not really "traps," they're just plain thirsty. 
		</p>
		<a href="s.html" style="color: white; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; background-color: blue; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    		Meme ads
		</a>
		<p>
			Probably why any readers are here. Not much to say.
		</p>
		<a href="d.html" style="color: white; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; background-color: blue; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    		Single aspect ads
		</a>
		<p>
			These are the ads that pick out one aspect of a story and promote that. It has all the ads of some guy staring at a big monster. Look here for any ads that emphasize one moment, decision, or theme, while leaving the rest of the story with much less detail.
		</p>
		<a href="k.html" style="color: white; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; background-color: blue; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    		Cover ads
		</a>
		<p>
			Anything I could envision on either side of a paperback cover. Ranges from a picture with cover vibes, to literal book covers. This is where to find ads that cram in all the info about what to expect from a story.
		</p>
		<a href="l.html" style="color: white; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; background-color: blue; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    		Other ads
		</a>
		<p>
			Exists to spare me hard decisions. Contains a bunch of ads that could have gone in any catagory, a few unfunny (according to me) memes, and the only picture of a real person in any of these ads.

    		The code for this page, including an early iteration of the script I made it with, is on <a href="https://github.com/Emmalemon2/rr-ad-list">my github</a>. Feel free to check it out. I include the ad scraping script for curious people, but it would best best if you don't go making your own versions of this list for no reason. Scraping ads for one list has a very small impact, but several people doing it would start to add up.
