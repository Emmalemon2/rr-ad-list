# RR Ad Catalogue

</header>

Hello. This program/webpage works by pretending to be a chapter of royal road, and loading the ads. Times a thousand or so. 
<br>
<br>
The ads are paid for by the click, not impressions, so I shouldn't harm the authors' investment. If you click on an ad, I would guess it does count, but I'm fine with that. You should be here to find something to read anyway, and just got lost looking at this page.
<br>
<br>
If you want to contribute or talk or something, I'm unlikely to look at this github often. Steal my code, or message me on RR.
<br>
